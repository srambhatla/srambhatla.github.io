I am a second year Ph.D. (EE) student advised by [Prof. Jarvis Haupt](http://www.ece.umn.edu/~jdhaupt/) at the [University of Minnesota- Twin Cities](http://www.ece.umn.edu/). 

My areas of interests are machine learning, statistical signal processing, compressive sensing, source separation and image processing.
