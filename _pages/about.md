I am an Assistant Professor in [Information Sciences and Data Analytics](https://uwaterloo.ca/management-sciences/research/information-systems) at the [Management Sciences Department](https://uwaterloo.ca/management-sciences/) in the Faculty of Engineering at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca). I am also affiliated with the [Waterloo Artificial Intelligence Institute (Waterloo.AI)](https://uwaterloo.ca/artificial-intelligence-institute/). 

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral fellow at the [Melady Lab](https://melady.usc.edu/){:target="\_blank"} mentored by Prof. Yan Liu in the Computer Science Department, Viterbi School of Engineering, at the
[University of Southern California](https://www.cs.usc.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. I undertook my doctoral studies with [Prof. Jarvis Haupt](https://www.ece.umn.edu/~jdhaupt/){:target="\_blank"}  in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the 
[University of Minnesota-Twin Cities](https://www.ece.umn.edu/){:target="\_blank"}.
