This is a quick start guide to jumpstart your exciting world of supercomputing using the resources at the [Minnesota Supercomputing Institute] (MSI), with a focus on running MATLAB. These resources will soon become your best friend, when it comes to running time consuming simulations. I will discuss some tips and tricks of making most of these resources. So, let's get started!

First things first, you will need an account with MSI. If your research group is already approved, you can head over to [their login page] and activate your account. Once the activation mail has graced your inbox, you are officially part of the family.

## Logging In
Head over to terminal and type in the following,
