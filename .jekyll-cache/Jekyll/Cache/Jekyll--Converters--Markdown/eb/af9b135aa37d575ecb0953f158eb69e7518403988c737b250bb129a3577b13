I"æ<p>This post is an overview of my thesis work carried out at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. My thesis work examines a semi-blind source separation problem which finds applications in audio, image, and video processing. The primary aim of this tutorial is to develop an overall intuitive understanding of my work. Suitable examples from our day-to-day lives are employed to motivate and develop the algorithmic framework.</p>
